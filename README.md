# What is Monty Hall's Paradox?
Monty Hall's paradox is a famous probabilistic problem.   

To briefly explain the rules,   

Behind each of the three doors are two goats and a car.   

If you pick a car, you can get a car as a gift.   

The host knows the location of the goat, so after my choice, I open the door containing the goat among the other two options.   

And it gives you a chance to change.   

Let's say you picked A out of 3 doors [A B C].   

The host opened a C containing goat.   

In this case, the batch is [A(you) B C(goat)].   

Then would it be beneficial for me to switch to B,   

Or would it be beneficial to stay still with A?
